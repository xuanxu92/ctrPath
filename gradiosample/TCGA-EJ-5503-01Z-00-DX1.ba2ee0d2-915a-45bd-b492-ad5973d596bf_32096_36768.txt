The prostatic tissue exhibits glandular structures with epithelial cells showing pleomorphism, enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, indicating cellular atypia. The surrounding dense, fibrous connective tissue stroma lacks invasion by glandular cells. Glandular architecture is somewhat preserved but deviates from the uniform pattern of benign prostatic tissue, suggesting a potential malignant process.
