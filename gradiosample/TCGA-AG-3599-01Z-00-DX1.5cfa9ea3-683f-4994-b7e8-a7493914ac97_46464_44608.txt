The rectal tissue image reveals glandular crowding, size, and shape variability indicative of an adenomatous process. Epithelial cells display pseudostratification with hyperchromatic, elongated nuclei, and increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios. Prominent nucleoli are present. The lamina propria contains inflammatory cells. These features suggest dysplasia while maintaining glandular architecture.
