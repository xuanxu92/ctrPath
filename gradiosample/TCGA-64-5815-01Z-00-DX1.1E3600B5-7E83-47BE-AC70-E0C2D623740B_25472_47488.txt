The lung tissue exhibits extensive fibrosis with dense, pink-staining collagen replacing normal alveolar spaces. Alveolar walls are thickened, lacking delicate septae. Fibrotic areas are irregular and patchy, with scattered inflammatory cells, indicating chronic inflammation. The distorted lung architecture suggests severe fibrotic disease, likely pulmonary fibrosis.
