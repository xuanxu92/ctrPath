The microscopic image reveals a thyroid neoplasm with papillary architecture. Cells display enlarged, irregular nuclei, some with prominent nucleoli, scant to moderate cytoplasm, and are arranged around fibrovascular cores. Background colloid-like material is present. These features suggest a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
