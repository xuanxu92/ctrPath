The liver tissue exhibits hepatocyte pleomorphism, hyperchromatic nuclei suggesting cellular atypia, and disrupted architecture. Lipofuscin pigment indicates oxidative stress or aging. Sinusoidal spaces are compressed. No significant fibrosis or inflammation observed. These findings suggest potential pre-neoplastic changes or aging effects in the liver.
