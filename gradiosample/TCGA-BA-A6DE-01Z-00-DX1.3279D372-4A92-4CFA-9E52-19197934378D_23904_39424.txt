The microscopic image reveals squamous cell carcinoma, characterized by a keratin pearl, surrounded by pleomorphic, atypical squamous cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. There's an increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and disorganized tissue architecture, typical of malignancy. These findings indicate well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, displaying both malignant and squamous cell differentiation.
