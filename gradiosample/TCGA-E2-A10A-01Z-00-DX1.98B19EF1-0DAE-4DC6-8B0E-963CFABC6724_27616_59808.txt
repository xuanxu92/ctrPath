The breast tissue image shows a ductal structure with epithelial cell pleomorphism, hyperchromatic nuclei, and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios. The duct's architecture is irregular. The surrounding stroma is fibrous with inflammatory cells. These features indicate atypical ductal hyperplasia or ductal carcinoma in situ, suggestive of proliferative breast lesions.
