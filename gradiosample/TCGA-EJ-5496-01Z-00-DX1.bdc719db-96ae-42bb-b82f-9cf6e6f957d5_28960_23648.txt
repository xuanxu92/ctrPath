The tissue displays spindle-shaped cells with elongated nuclei arranged in interlacing fascicles, characteristic of smooth muscle cells, likely from the prostate gland. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic; the stroma is collagenous. No signs of malignancy like nuclear atypia or mitotic figures are observed. These features are consistent with benign prostatic smooth muscle.
